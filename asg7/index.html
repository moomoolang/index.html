      <h2>Platform & Vision</h2>
      
      <div class="policy-points">
        <p><strong>Empowering Inter-Species Relations:</strong> The management of Rumi will focus on maintaining a good relationship between human and demon communities through a series of diplomatic relations. With the help of better communication channels, joint programs and so on, we will be able to get out of the historic tension towards the real cooperation and understanding.
</p>
        
        <p><strong>Universal Safety and Rights: </strong>All creatures in Huntrx universe (irrespective of species) are entitled to equal protection and enjoyment of the law and the freedom to pursue their ambitions without any fear. The broad-based safety program will make sure that the human beings and the demons are able to live safe and preserve their cultural identities.
</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hunter Organization Reform: </strong>It is time to change our hunter organization to the 21 st century. In our reform scheme, we will have reformed training protocols, better equipment and technology, better communication systems and better coordination of various hunter divisions in order to make them as effective as possible.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Unity Through Diversity: </strong> The Huntrx universe is strong due to its diversity. Instead of letting the differences create a rift, the vision presented by Rumi is appreciative of the individual contributions that each community has made towards our future. We can create an actual unified society through education, cultural exchange schemes and through the inclusion of all in policy making..</p>
