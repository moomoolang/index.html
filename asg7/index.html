      <div class="policy-points">
        <p><strong>Strengthening Inter-Species Relations:</strong> Rumi's administration will prioritize building stronger diplomatic ties between human and demon communities. Through improved communication channels and collaborative programs, we can move beyond historical tensions toward genuine cooperation and mutual understanding.</p>
        
        <p><strong> Universal Safety & Rights:</strong> Every being in the Huntrx universe - regardless of species - deserves equal protection under the law and the freedom to pursue their goals without fear. Our comprehensive safety initiative will ensure that both humans and demons can live securely while maintaining their unique cultural identities.</p>
        
        <p><strong> Hunter Organization Reform:</strong> It's time to modernize our hunter organization for the 21st century. Our reform plan includes updated training protocols, improved equipment and technology, streamlined communication systems, and enhanced coordination between different hunter divisions for maximum effectiveness.</p>
        
        <p><strong> Unity Through Diversity:</strong> The strength of the Huntrx universe lies in its diversity. Rather than allowing differences to divide us, Rumi's vision embraces the unique contributions each community brings to our shared future. Through education, cultural exchange programs, and inclusive policy-making, we can build a truly unified society.</p>
      </div>
      

      <p><em>Together, we can create a Huntrx universe where cooperation triumphs over conflict, and where every being has the opportunity to thrive.</em></p>
