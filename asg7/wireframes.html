	<h1>The Advantages of having wireframe sketches over wireframe softwares</h1>
	<p>Its quicker, more flexible and isn't very distracting in the early stages of web-development.</p>

	<h2>The Disadvantages of having wireframe sketches  over wireframe softwares</h2>
	<p> It's lower quality which means it is low fidelity, often is duplicate work, there is a huge lack of interactivity and limited collaboration ( as it is non-digital), which me it is not able to be edited or shared as much as you can with digital softwares.
 </p>
	
    <h3> Which type of wireframing style would work best with my project and why?</h3>
    <p> I believe Digital wireframing would work better with using software like Figma and since it involves user-specific customization ,the digital wireframe allows interactive components , editing and collaboration.</p>
