	<h1>Possible Domain Names</h1>
	<p>Here are my produtivity website possible domain names I could use.</p>
	<ul> <b>Nexus.io </b>: Your Productivity Hub, share with anyone (your group members, friends, family)</ul>
	<ul><b> Axis.net  </b>: Your Personalized Productivity Space from anywhere</ul>
	<ul><b>MomentumLab.com </b>: Emphasis Progress and stress-free productivity</ul>

	<h2> Domain Naming Discussion Summary</h2>
	<p> 
Based on the domain choices I had for my productivity website, my partner said that the first choice seems cool and interesting, but its a bit too lengthy for a website in general. As for axisspaces.io I would probably have to change it to <b> axispaces.io </b>instead because of the spelling, as someone who may have dyslexia, they would get the spelling wrong and be redricted tot the wong website, but he did say it was pretty neat. As for the last one, it seems good but theres no particular feeling tied to it. 
</p>
	<p> I really like <b> MomentumLab.so </b> because it feels very personalized for anyone who wishes to be more productive and get more work flowing rather than just a basic name that has a nice ring. Sure it may not tie any particular feelings to it when someone may read it or see it, but it really does feel like you get Momentum flowing when you do use the productivity site. </p>
