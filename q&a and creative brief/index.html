    <h2>1. Web Design Do's and Don'ts - Breaking of rule number 6 (Clickable elements are not noticeable)
)</h2>
    <p>
     An example of violation: the article displays an element which has the appearance of a button. 
But it is not really clickable, (orange box with label). This is ambiguous since visuals imply to be interactive.

    <h2>2. Storytelling to enhance better User Experience-- Why framing your project as a story is the best way to refine ideas.</h2>
    <p>
      By framing your project as a story, you are forced to organize your work around a beginning, middle, and end, who is the user, what problem they have, what journey/steps will help them resolve that problem, and what result or resolution do you wish to achieve. This clarity assists in narrowing the scope (you can see what is essential and what is extraneous), prioritizing, staying focused on the needs of the user not the features, and making the design coherent (so that all elements of the design serve the story). It also enables you to test consistency: when some section of the work does not fit into your narrative, it may not belong and it may require reconsideration.

    <h2>3. Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography - How to create emphasis / hierarchy in typography.

      <ul>
        <li>V Different size (i.e. bigger headline, smaller body). 
[oaicite:2]{index=2}</li>
        <li> Using weight (bold vs regular):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</li>
        <li>     Contrast of color (dark, light or other color).[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>
        <li>  Style (caps, italics, lower / upper-cases):contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>
        <li>Whitespace / nearness / affiliation to similar data and isolate less significant data. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Reference to a good example of hierarchy: <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/visual-hierarchy/">“The ultimate guide to visual hierarchy” (Canva) example</a> :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
