	<h1>My favorite musical band: Cigarettes After Sex</h1>
	<p>Cigarettes after sex is an American band that was formed in El Paso, Texas that is known for their dreamy musical style, often described for their bruding music type. </p>
	<h2>Why is Cigarettes After Sex my favorite musical band?</h2>
	<p>The reason why Cigarettes After Sex is my favorite is because despite how slow their songs may be, they always seem to calm me down when i'm having a rough day or when I feel down. They manage to get me through days when I feel demotivated and their music is pretty distinct and never fails to make me feel amazed by how well they make their music</p>
