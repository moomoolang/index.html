        <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="Ethan">
        <p>I would like to include my partner, Ethan to this dinner because he's a very meaningful person in my life. Excluding him, wouldn't make this night special and memorable, and I want to invite other people who will make the night fun and entertaining.</p>

      <div class="guest-card">
        <img src="images/rumi.jpg" alt="Rumi">
        <p>Rumi is an iconic character from Kpop Demon Hunters. Both Ethan and I love her character, and we are also matching as Rumi and Jinu on Discord, it would be great to have her join our dinner as one of the guests of honor.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guest-card">
        <img src="images/jinu.gif" alt="Jinu">
        <p>Jinu is another cool character from Kpop Demon Hunters. Ethan and I love these characters and match as them and we relate to them, so having Jinu at the dinner completes the trio and makes the evening even more fun and meaningful.</p>
