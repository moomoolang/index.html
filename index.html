	<h1>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h1>
	<p>Structured content frames contents such as articles as chunks of data that relate to eachother than just pages that are read, while semantic html is markup that is the code, rather than just data than just listing how it looks like on screen.</p>
	
		<h2>How do they work together?</h2>
		<p>Structured content organizes data into different parts such as headings, lists and data while semantic HTML creates a markup of those parts and labels it and together they work together to create data that is readable like hours or showing location.</p>

		<h3>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>
		<p>It's important to have both of these in your web pages as they are easier to be discovered, more accurate, and accesible for all.</p>

  <h2>Responses to Required Readings</h2>

  <h3>Banishing Your Inner Critic (Denise Jacobs)</h3>
  <p>Jacobs discusses a “troll-like” inner critic that undermines our confidence. The method that would be most successful for me is <strong>reframing negative self-talk</strong>—actively recognizing and replacing it with constructive, realistic statements. This works best for me because I tend to overthink mistakes, and reframing allows me to focus on solutions rather than criticism.</p>

  <h3>Procrastination (David McRaney)</h3>
  <p>“Hyperbolic discounting” is the tendency to prioritize immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards. One method McRaney identifies to counteract it is <strong>breaking tasks into smaller, immediate steps</strong>. This would work best for me because small, manageable steps make starting tasks less intimidating and help maintain focus.</p>

  <h3>Critical Web Design: Ch. 1. Networks</h3>
  <p>Critical Web Design discusses four types of power in networks. As a creator and publisher of my work, I have <strong>influence through content creation</strong> and <strong>visibility in my network</strong>, but limited structural control over external platforms. I can design my pages and manage content, but I cannot control how information spreads outside my site.</p>
